Born in Mexico and raised in California, he first taught Spanish at university before embarking on a military career in the French Foreign Legion. Five years in the infantry followed, during which he developed a deep attachment to the French countryside."

      {
        "content": "In 2019, he traded the green beret for red and white juice. He trained alongside an outstanding mentor in one of the Northern Rhône’s most respected appellations — Matthieu Barret in Cornas — before completing a BTS degree in viticulture and oenology with a focus on organic farming in the Jura. At the same time, personal savings and harvest work on a friend’s vineyards allowed him to begin building his own négociant activity."

    "description1": "In the cellar, Josimar’s priority is to produce clean, precise and reliable wines, with a clear sense of responsibility toward those who open and share them. A wine must be alive and expressive, but also readable, stable and consistent from bottle to bottle. Energy, drinkability, finesse, complexity and length on the palate guide the development of each cuvée.",
    "description2": "Vinifications are carried out in a simple and precise manner, without fining or filtration, without oenological additives, and with very limited additions of SO₂ — generally around 30 mg/L total, depending on the vintage. Strict attention is paid to the hygiene of all equipment and vessels, an essential condition for the stability and reliability of the wines. A significant proportion of the wines are aged in 54-liter glass demijohns or in stainless steel tanks, in order to preserve fruit purity, natural balance and the faithful expression of the wine.",
